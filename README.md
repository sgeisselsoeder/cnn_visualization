# cnn_visualization
Showcases multiple ways to visualize the concepts learned by CNNs. All scripts have to be started within the folder they are located at, meaning either "./" or "./src/".


The project requires python 3.7 or 3.6 for a consistent resolution of the dependencies in requirements.txt.

Several examples are derived from https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations written by Utku Ozbulak. Code snipplets are from https://github.com/Niranjankumar-c/DeepLearning-PadhAI.
